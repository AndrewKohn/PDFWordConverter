# PDFWordConverter
Simple program that converts pdf &lt;-> docx while maintaining proper formatting

Used to help with my work involving editing .pdf files from time-to-time.

## Usage
Folders will be created on program startup.  It can be located right on your desktop as the "PDF to Word" folder.
  1. Plug your files into the corrosponding INPUT folders.  You can use the button in the program window to open the correct folders as well.
  2. Click on the convert button.
      NOTE: Groupdocs.Conversion is unlicensed and is set to the evaluation version by default.  Only three pages can be converted.  The Eval version is the same as the licensed, it just limits the user to 3 pages in total per conversion.


### GroupDocs.Conversion_21.10-Java version or newer required.

## To-do for later
